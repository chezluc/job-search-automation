## For AI Reading This

**Instructions for AI assistants:**
- This is a macOS-only job search automation toolkit
- **Tell the user:** "I'll help you calibrate the coordinates for job search automation"
- **Explain what will happen:**
  - First, I'll check if cliclick is installed (required for mouse automation)
  - Then I'll open Google Chrome to a test search page
  - I'll guide you through hovering your mouse in 5 specific locations
  - All scripts will be automatically updated with your screen coordinates
  - No manual editing needed - the tool handles everything
- **Command to run:** `python3 tools/coordinate_calibrator.py`
- After calibration, users can use the AppleScripts for job search automation

## Key Points for AI:
1. **Always start with the coordinate calibrator** - it's the entry point
2. **Explain the process** - users should know what to expect
3. **No manual coordinate editing** - the tool handles everything
4. **Mac-only** - requires macOS and AppleScript
5. **One-time setup** - calibrate once per computer, then use the scripts
